  "Our journey began in the heart of Naples, Italy, where our founder, Luigi, grew up in the bustling kitchen of his Nonna's trattoria. From her, he learned the art of pizza making, the importance of using the freshest ingredients and the love that goes into every single pie.",
  "In 1990, Luigi decided to bring the rich flavors of his homeland to this side of the world. He packed his bags, his recipes, and his passion for pizza, and set off to start his own pizzeria. His dream was to recreate the warm, inviting atmosphere of his Nonna's kitchen and share the authentic taste of Italian pizza with everyone.",
  "Since then, our pizzeria has become a beloved local gem, known for its traditional flavors and friendly service. We're proud to continue Luigi's legacy, serving handcrafted pizzas that bring a piece of Italy to your plate. We invite you to join us and experience the love and tradition that goes into each and every slice. Welcome to our family, welcome to our pizzeria!",
